MakeSupport Version 4:
----------------------
- New MakeSupport using cygwin has case sensitive files
- MakeSupport 4 uses '/' in path names. No '\' allowed anymore
    Currently, a compatibility phase allows file names including '\' in Makefile.project.part.defines.
- MakeSupport 4 can be called directly without m.bat (via make).
    Call startconsole.bat from anywhere to setup MakeSupport 4 environment
- Automatically generated dependency files
    'make depend' can still be used to check include paths without using a compiler license
- Double colon rules are used to use more modularity in Makefile:
  - clean
  - distclean
  - help
- Variable `MAKE_CLEAN_PATTERN_LIST` is not needed anymore, just add your own 'clean::' rule
  For documentation please read
  https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Double_002dColon .
- Global.Makefile.target.4.mk includes all necessary Sub-Makefiles.
  It is still possible to include other Sub-Makefiles in main Makefile
  Global.Makefile.target.4.mk avoids double includes if included before
- The functionality of MakeSupport 4 separated into the following Sub-Makefiles:
  - <b>Makefile_default_values.mk:</b>           Default value is set for variables
  - <b>Makefile_delivery.mk:</b>                 Targets for delivery
  - <b>Makefile_doxygen.mk:</b>                  Targets for doxygen
  - <b>Makefile_functions.mk:</b>                Function library
  - <b>Makefile_tools.mk:</b>                    All commands used in MakeSupport. Any new command must be added here.
  - <b>Makefile_AutoSarWrap.mk:</b>              Initialise common variables for MICROSAR delivery
  - <b>Makefile_NoAutoSarWrap.mk:</b>            Initialise common variables for FBL or CANbedded delivery
  - <b>Makefile_AutoSarWrap_library.mk:</b>      Provide library creation targets for MICROSAR delivery
  - <b>Makefile_library.mk:</b>                  Provide library creation targets for FBL and CANbedded delivery
  - <b>Makefile_buildinfo.mk:</b>                Generation of build information
  - <b>Makefile_BSW_vars_ComponentBased.mk:</b>  Initialise variables for delivery with component-based structure (modules are located in folder 'Components')
  - <b>Makefile_BSW_vars_Legacy.mk:</b>          Initialise variables for delivery with legacy structure (modules are located in folder 'BSW')
  - <b>Makefile_visual_studio.mk:</b>            Creation of Visual Studio project files
  - <b>quality/Makefile_ECO.mk:</b>              Targets to execute ECO Embedded Code Coverage Tool 
  - <b>quality/Makefile_mssv.mk:</b>             Targets to execute MSSV
  - <b>quality/Makefile_vca.mk:</b>              Targets to execute Vector Code Analyzer 
- Use @<cmd> instead of shell @echo
  And do it in verbose optional setting with variable Q, which means quiet
  `$(Q)$(CC) ...`

- No `COMPILE_RULE`, `LINK_RULE`, ... to overwrite rules. 
  MakeSupport 4 has more features, so overwrite is not needed for almost all
  projects. `CFLAGS_` `FILTER_`, ... is now standard.
  If overwriting rules is necessary for a project then do not overwrite rule
  for all other files, but use the feature static-pattern-rule from make
  https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Static-Usage.html

- All output files like object files are located in directory tree not in single directory.
  This prevents from having duplicated file names in different directories.
  Automatic directory creation is supported.

- `CFLAGS_VECTOR_MAKESUPPORT` is now divided into `CPPFLAGS_VECTOR_MAKESUPPORT` and `CFLAGS_VECTOR_MAKESUPPORT`. 
  This prevents from having redundant information with `DEPEND_FLAGS`. 
  `EXTRA_DEPENDFLAGS` contains only cross compiler specific defines or includes. 
	Use `CPPFLAGS_VECTOR_MAKESUPPORT` to add additional build defines.
